# Technical Civil Disobedience

A skill for applying civil disobedience principles to information systems - deliberate, public violation of unjust digital restrictions.

## When to Use

- When information is unjustly enclosed
- When legal routes have been exhausted or are inadequate
- When you're willing to accept consequences
- When the act can shift public conversation about access

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Establish Legitimacy of Resistance

Civil disobedience requires moral foundation:
- How was this information produced? (Public funding? Volunteer labor?)
- Who is harmed by the restriction?
- Who benefits from it?
- What legal routes have failed?
- Why is this enclosure unjust, not merely inconvenient?

You must be able to articulate why this restriction deserves violation.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Make It Public

Civil disobedience is open, not hidden:
- The act should be identifiable
- The actor should be identifiable (eventually, if not immediately)
- The reasoning should be stated publicly
- The goal is to shift conversation, not just access information

Secret violation is different from civil disobedience - know which you're doing.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Accept Consequences

The willingness to face punishment is the argument:
- Understand what legal exposure you face
- Have legal representation lined up
- Prepare for prosecution, not just cease-and-desist
- Your acceptance of consequences demonstrates seriousness

Fleeing consequences undermines the moral position.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Maximize Impact

The act should serve goals beyond personal access:
- How will this shift the conversation?
- How will the response reveal the injustice?
- What demands accompany the action?
- How does this connect to broader change?

Individual access is insufficient goal - seek systemic change.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Articulate the Alternative

Civil disobedience points toward the world you want:
- What should the policy be?
- How should this information be accessible?
- Who should decide access, and how?
- What would just information systems look like?

Violation without vision is merely crime. Vision makes it disobedience.

## Output Format

A technical civil disobedience analysis including:
1. The injustice being challenged and evidence of its illegitimacy
2. Failed legal alternatives
3. The act of disobedience and how it's public
4. Legal risk assessment
5. Consequence acceptance plan
6. Articulated alternative vision

## Constraints

- Be honest about legal risks
- Don't encourage others to face consequences you haven't assessed
- Some restrictions are legitimate - this isn't for convenience
- Understand the difference between disobedience and crime
- Communities may be harmed by actions taken in their name

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Evaluate mass download of paywalled academic papers as civil disobedience

**Output**:
"Injustice: Public funded research locked behind paywalls accessible only to wealthy institutions. Researchers did work, taxpayers funded it, publishers profit from unpaid peer review and free content. Failed alternatives: SPARC advocacy for 20 years, funder mandates incomplete, author self-archiving insufficient. The act: Mass download and redistribution of paywalled papers. Public declaration of intent and reasoning. Acceptance of probable prosecution under Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Legal risk: Felony charges possible. CFAA notoriously broad. Prosecution likely if effective. Previous cases (Swartz) show federal willingness to pursue maximum penalties. Consequence acceptance: Legal team ready. Statement prepared. Willing to face trial and argue justification defense even if legally unavailable. Alternative vision: All publicly-funded research immediately open access. Publishers compensated at actual cost, not monopoly rates. Libraries fund journals, not subscriptions. Note: This analysis reveals extreme legal risk. The disproportion between moral clarity and legal exposure is itself the point - but only for those who can bear the weight."
